problem Undefined type intelephense in vscode 
==============================================

Troubleshooting Undefined type intelephense (1009). In the latest update from PHP Intelephense, intelephense keeps showing errors for undefined symbols for routes (and other classes too), there has been no error like this before and it is annoying.

I'm one of those people who don't really like to see the error red color everywhere, it's itchy and uncomfortable hahahah.
